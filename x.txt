im running a data migration.
take a look at the @batch_processor.js then at the @data/data_handling/live folder, and then at the samples from @data/one_payload 
the issue im encountering rightn now is that after running that some values of columns where allways null:
Drehmoment_Min
Drehmoment_Max
Winkel_Nom
Winkel_Ist
Winkel_Min
Winkel_Max
in no row where those values inserted.
read also the @jsonkeys.txt to see where those values are stored.
and help me design some sort of testing of in how many payloads those values where sent
